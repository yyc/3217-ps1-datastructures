Question:
Dictionary keys must conform to the Hashable protocol. Why is this necessary?

Answer:
Because the underlying implementation of Dictionary is a hash table, and as such keys have to correspond to entries in the hash table in some predictable way.

Having Dictionary keys conform to the hashable protocol has two components:
1. possessing an Integer .hashValue property
2. conforming to the Equatable protocol

The first allows for the key to correspond to a numbered offset in the hash table (subject to modulus and other transformations)
The second allows for keys to be compared and the correct value to be retrieved from the hash table, as well as for collision detection and resolution.
